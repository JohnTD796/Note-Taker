# Note-Taker
  
  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the way the GET and POST paths work along with the server that was created in the server.js file. Im still confused as to what is going on a and how/why some of the things are done the way they are, but this challenge helped solidify some of the basics.

  ## Technologies
